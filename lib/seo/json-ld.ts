 * Structured data for the home page, emitted as `application/ld+json`.

 * `WebApplication` rather than `SoftwareApplication` because there is nothing
 * to download: the studio is the page. The `offers` price is genuinely zero —
 * the app charges nothing and every generation bills to the visitor's own
 * provider key — and `description` says so, because a free-price claim with no
 * explanation invites the wrong expectation.
 *
 * Built from the same registries the UI renders, so a new engine or mode shows
 * up here without anyone remembering to edit a second list.
