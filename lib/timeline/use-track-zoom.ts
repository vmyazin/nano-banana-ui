 * slides off screen because the content grew underneath a fixed scroll
 * position. So every zoom records the instant under the gesture and how far
 * into the viewport it sat, and the track puts it back there once the wider
 * layout exists. Anchoring on *time* rather than on a fraction of the content
 * width is what makes it exact — untimed blocks keep a fixed width at every
 * zoom, so content width does not scale uniformly and a ratio would drift.
 *
 * Both gestures are listened for natively rather than through React props,
 * because both must call `preventDefault` and React attaches `wheel` and
 * `touchmove` passively — a passive listener cannot cancel, so the browser
 * would zoom the whole page instead of the track.
