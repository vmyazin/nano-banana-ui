 * records up in the gallery store — so a cloud asset has to become a gallery
 * record before it can be placed at all. This is the direction that was
 * missing: `lib/account/import.ts` sends browser bytes up, and
 * `lib/account/reference.ts` pulls a cloud *image* into the draft, but nothing
 * brought a cloud *video* down into the library the editor reads.
 *
 * Records made here are pinned for the same reason imported ones are. Their
 * only re-fetchable source is the relative `/api/account/assets/<id>/content`,
 * and `isDownloadableMediaUrl` rejects a relative URL — so acquire's
 * download-again branch cannot rescue these bytes once eviction takes them.
 * Holding the file is the only durability they have.
