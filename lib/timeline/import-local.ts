 * it has no `sourceUrl`, so nothing can ever fetch it again. A generated clip
 * that gets evicted loses a URL that may still work; an evicted import is gone
 * from the app for good. That is why these are pinned at creation rather than
 * merely stored, and why a storage refusal has to be reported loudly — a failed
 * import leaves nothing behind at all.
