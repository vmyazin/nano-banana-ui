 * for the next one without finding it on disk again — and the picker that
 * offers "stored images" was empty for anyone who had only ever uploaded, which
 * is what made Replace a dead end.
 *
 * Every upload is now kept in the browser library, and pushed to the cloud
 * library as well when there is an account to hold it. Both are the same call:
 * the cloud import takes a gallery record, so the local write is what makes the
 * upload importable at all.
