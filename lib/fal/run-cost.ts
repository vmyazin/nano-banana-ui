/**
 * What one run of a fal model costs, addressed the way a workspace holds it.
 *
 * Separate from `lib/fal/pricing.ts`, which is deliberately dependency-free so
 * the estimate route and client-side capture can share it; this one reaches for
 * the catalog and the rate table, so it stays on the client side of that line.
 *
 * The endpoint lookup lives here rather than in the caller for a specific
 * reason: a component that reads `variant.endpointId` during render and hands
 * it to an imported helper makes the React compiler treat `variant` as possibly
 * mutated, and it then skips optimizing that component altogether. Taking the
 * model id and mode keeps the variant object out of the caller's render, and
 * taking the controls as separate primitives avoids the other half of the same
 * trap — an options object built at the call site.
