 * reason worth recording: the fal workspace derives its control values from the
 * selected variant, so handing any of those values to an imported helper during
 * that component's render makes the React compiler treat the variant as
 * possibly mutated — and it then declines to preserve the workspace's existing
 * memoization and skips optimizing the file. Crossing into a child on props
 * puts the lookup somewhere the workspace's own memoization is not at stake.
 *
 * Renders nothing when fal never published a rate for this combination. A
 * missing figure is a silence; a nearby figure would be a guess the reader has
 * no reason to doubt.
